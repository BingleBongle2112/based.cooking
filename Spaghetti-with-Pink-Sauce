- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 2- 10 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 30 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4
## Ingredients

- Spaghetti of any kind
- Red sauce of any kind (1 jar or two cups)
- Heavy Whipping Cream of the same proportion (or a little less, depending on how thick you prefer your sauce)
- Optional ingredients include italian herbs, red pepper flakes, mushrooms, olives, meatballs, wine or vodka, ham, anything you would like.

## Directions
1. Prepare ingredients in a sensible manner, washing vegetables, measuring, ect. Set a small flame for simmering.
2. A useful preparation for mushrooms and olives includes desiccation (leaving them in a bowl of salt, or merely salting them and leaving them in a bowl for a while.)
3. Into a medium saucepan, pour a jar of red sauce as you would for regular spaghetti. You decide the amounts based on how many are being served and prefrence.
4. Pour an equal, proportional amount of heavy whipping cream into the red sauce, incorporating the two on a low heat. This will be rather soupy, but will reduce and thicken with time. 
5. Now would be a good time to include any additional ingredients according to taste. Within 10 minutes, or however long it takes to prepare sauce normally, this shall be ready.
